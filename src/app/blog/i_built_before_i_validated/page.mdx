My website design looked like crap.

I was ready to launch my first Google Ads campaign for Rippl when I took an honest look at my 
landing page. Bare bones design, engineer-friendly (aka lifeless) copy, zero visual 
appeal. I realized I was about to pay for traffic to a website that would convince exactly 
nobody to sign up.

I built Rippl before I validated the idea.

<AlignedImage src={burning_house_meme} alt="" />

I started building it to solve my own problem: stop wasting time manually repurposing my blog 
posts for social media. Eventually, I decided to productize it because I assumed I wasn’t 
the only person dealing with this problem. After launching the product, the new mission was 
to find customers. For quick and (relatively) cheap validation, I decided to use Google 
Ads. 

That’s when it hit me.

The website design was terrible. The tool worked for me but I’m trying to find customers other 
than myself. It is the classic builders’ problem: don’t build before you validate. And I did 
exactly what I knew I shouldn’t have.


<Header1 spacing="tight">The Building Trap</Header1>

You think you’re building a product, but you’re really hiding.  Anyone can build a 
product. It takes more to build a product that people will pay for. You can hide 
behind building to avoid the big scary monster: sales and marketing.

Sure, you start by building a tool that solves your own problem. But building for 
yourself is nothing like building for customers. If you’re the only user, you can 
cut corners and ignore a lot of problems. When you’re building for customers, you have to 
address those problems and solve them. The customers are the ones who will pay, not you.

You finish building and everything is working but you didn’t build with customers in 
mind. The product solves the problem but it looks like an undergraduate project. There’s 
nothing to convince prospects to stick around and see just how good the product is.

Good functionality does not guarantee a good product. You need the whole picture: 
functionality and design. If your landing page doesn’t convincingly speak to the value 
of your product, you’re going to be shipping into the void.


<Header1 spacing="tight">What I Learned About Engineering for Marketing</Header1>


<Header3>Building isn't hiding (but I was using it that way)</Header3>

I told myself I was perfecting the product. Really, I was avoiding 
the hard part: putting it in front of strangers who might reject 
it. Building felt productive and safe. Marketing felt scary and uncertain.

With Rippl, I built up false confidence by telling myself "I'm 
building this to solve my own problem so surely others will 
see the value." That was all belief and no substance.

Exactly what I shouldn't have done.

The lesson: Building isn't procrastination if you're doing it right. Follow 
the principle of "good is good enough." If you find yourself adding 
features with the goal of perfection, you've veered off course.

<Header3>Your user base isn’t you, even if you solve your own problem first</Header3>

If you build something for yourself and later decide to productize it, your scope 
has changed entirely. It's a different game with different rules altogether. When 
you build for yourself, you can play it fast and loose. Not so when you productize.

The lesson: Be honest with yourself from the beginning about your goal. If you 
ultimately want to productize and generate revenue, make sure all your choices 
bear that in mind. Your decisions should prioritize your customers, not you.

<Header3>Design is marketing</Header3>

Great design isn’t a feature. It’s expected. I wish we lived in a time where janky 
frontends still got great results. Unfortunately, great design is so accessible 
that anything less can be off-putting. Your design doesn’t have to be cutting edge, 
but it must be enough to keep a prospect interested.

The lesson: All of your design and product choices should ask the question: 
“Would this keep me engaged if it were someone else’s website?” If the answer is 
yes, great! If the answer is no, fix it.

all the rejection could happen. But that's also where all the reward happens.</PullQuote>

<Header1 spacing="tight">Where the Reward Lives</Header1>

Marketing felt like the scary thing because that's where all the rejection could happen. 
That's also where all the reward happens. I’ve realized they're the same space.

The bigger lesson is about being ruthlessly honest with myself from the start. 
What are my real intentions? If I want to build a business, then marketing isn't something 
I do after building - it's part of the building process from day one. I've been told this 
by successful people. I've read it in books. I thought I understood it, but fear trumped 
logic when it came time to actually execute.

I may not execute this perfectly next time. But at least now I know that avoiding marketing 
is avoiding the whole point.
