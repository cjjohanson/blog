Most people think of a blog as a finished product. You write it, publish it, and move on. 
Blogs are more like seeds. If you just leave them buried, they sit unseen. If you 
nurture them, they ripple outward and grow into something much bigger.

## Blogging Isn’t the Hard Part

Blogging isn't the hard part. Making sure people actually see it is. A blog should be the centerpoint of your ideas. The starting place, not the final resting place.

Every post can ripple outward into posts on LinkedIn, Twitter, and more. The main problem with that strategy: repurposing often takes longer than writing. That's the wall I kept slamming into.

## When Blogging Turns Into Busywork

When I talk to bloggers they all say the same thing: they don't want their work to sit and collect dust. They want their work to be seen, spark engagement, and feel like the effort pays off.

Instead, reformatting a single post eats up hours of their time that could be spent on writing, connecting, or actually living life. And the more time you spend stuck in tedious copy/paste busywork, the faster your creative energy drains away. Then writing becomes a chore instead of a joy.

## How I Save My Time

I didn't want to concede hours of my time to copy/paste work. Building things is where I get to be creative and every extra hour spent reformatting is an hour stolen from that.

So I built myself a system. I needed something that could take my blog post, understand my writing style and voice, and do all the heavy lifting for me. That's how I built [Rippl](https://postrippl.co).

Now I can write a blog post, drop it in, click a button, and get post-ready content repurposed across social media platforms. I even took it a step further: mini social media campaigns. That way, my ideas don't get chopped into random posts. They flow consistently across [Twitter](https://x.com/cjlovesdata), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cgjohanson/), [Threads](https://www.threads.com/@cjlovesdata), and [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/cjlovesdata.bsky.social).

## Time Is the Most Valuable Resource

Time is the most important resource. Guard it.

The moment you start spending it on work that kills your spark, you lose what makes the whole process fun. That was the whole point of building Rippl. I'd rather save my energy for what I love: building, communicating, and chasing curiosity.

I’m not always going to get it right and I don’t expect to. But I know that it’s something I’ll get better at every day.
