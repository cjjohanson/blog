I was on the phone with an admissions counselor for a graduate program in entrepreneurship, listening to her 
describe the quality of courses and professors and how this program would set me up for success.

But halfway through her pitch, I found myself asking “Is this true? Is more education the solution? Or is 
it delaying me from building the actual business now and learning through direct experience?”

<AlignedImage src={bus_meme} alt="" />

That phone call made me realize I'd been doing this for months. I was searching everywhere for someone who 
would have all the answers.
 
When you start building a business, you don’t know what you’re doing. You’ve never done this before.

Building a business is overwhelmingly vague. You start with your idea of an end result but don’t know how to get 
there. In fact, there are endless paths you can take. How do you know which to choose?

I’ve considered getting that second master’s degree. And certificates. And online courses. I watched plenty of 
YouTube videos. I’ve read books about building a business. I’ve scrolled endlessly through social media. All in 
an attempt to learn how to do the thing.

Part of us is hoping that there is someone out there with the answer to our questions. The solutions to our 
problems. Someone who has seen it all, done it all, and is able to share that information with us so we can get 
to our desired result of a successful business (with less pain, struggle, and embarrassment).

There are countless people and services who offer solutions to ALL of our problems. They offer their “proven 
frameworks” which have “made them $X million.”

All you have to do is click here to pay.

And we fall for it because we’re conditioned to believe that a perfect solution exists in the first place. We 
ask a question and an expert gives us an answer. That summarizes the teacher/student dynamic in a nutshell.

This dynamic doesn’t translate to entrepreneurship where your specific market, timing, and resources don’t match 
the case study they’re selling you. When you’re building a company, you’re usually figuring out problems by 
yourself. It gets lonely and frustrating. The fear and anxiety creep in, making you ask yourself “What the hell am 
I even doing?”

The “advice industrial complex” exploits this gap.

You pay for “proven frameworks” for problems that don’t have standard solutions and opinions disguised as universal 
truths. The advice is too generic or irrelevant.

You’re still left with the original problem and no solution for it.


<Header1 spacing="tight">Three Truths About Learning Entrepreneurship</Header1>

<TightGroup>

<Header3>There Is No Universal Answer</Header3>

  * Every successful founder you talk to says "it depends" and "under these circumstances"
  * If there were a money-printing formula, everyone would use it
  * Your business, market, timing, skills are unique combinations
  * The right answer for you doesn't exist until you create it through experimentation

</TightGroup>

<TightGroup>

<Header3>Community and Network Beat Courses</Header3>

  * Real communities give you contextual advice without hidden agendas
  * People aren't waiting for you to pull out your credit card
  * You get honest "here's what worked for me" vs. "here's the proven system"

Take my experience with Rippl. At a Boston Builders meetup, a friend suggested pivoting from product to 
service. That's contextual advice I'd never get from a course selling universal frameworks.

<Header3>Judgment Is Built, Not Bought</Header3>

  * You have to develop your own pattern recognition through experience
  * Community accelerates this by exposing you to more diverse experiences
  * Paying for answers delays the development of your own judgment
  * The goal isn't to find the right teacher, it's to become your own decision-maker

<Header1 spacing="tight">The Uncomfortable Truth</Header1>

I’m glad I didn’t enroll in that graduate program. It was what I wanted at the time but not what I needed. What 
I needed was to start “figuring it out” and I did that by building my first business: ArtsyPetz.

Once you accept that you have to figure it out on your own, it’s freeing. 

Community is about finding people who will help you build your capacity to make good decisions without incomplete 
information and without feeling completely alone. It’s not about finding another guru. It’s a mutual exchange with 
people who are also figuring it out.

The uncomfortable truth is that entrepreneurship is supposed to feel uncertain. That uncertainty isn't a bug you 
need to pay someone to fix. It's the crucible that transforms you from someone who doesn't know what they're doing 
into someone who can figure it out.
